# AssetTracking2
<strong>Education exercise to learn about Entity Framework</strong>

The project is a console app for an Asset Tracking Database. 
The aim is for a company to keep track of their assets (like laptops, phones, etc).
The presentation is a list of all the assets, which office they belong to, their purchase price, the price in local currency based on current rates from floatrate, and with a marker for how close they are to their end of life. 

The project was created using Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2022 - Version 17.2.4
